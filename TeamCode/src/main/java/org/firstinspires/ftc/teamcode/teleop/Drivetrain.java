    /* This approach is much more efficient considered to the first joysitck drivetrain for the reason that you don't need to create multiple threads,
    and that you don't need to have so many if statments checking for specific conditions of the controller and the joystick.

    This works by creating a variable that stores the postition of the joystick and either adds or subtracts based off of the needed movement

    At the end using the Math max and min functions the power is capped to a range between -1 and 1, as those are the motor's max and min values

    This drivetrain also may feature a tank drive system cause why not, we would just need to add the extras
